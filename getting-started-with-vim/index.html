            ## Why I have learned ViM

            I actually was forced to do so in some sense. I have worked in a company where everyone was using vim and
            it was a shame for me to open my IDE. Seeing how these guys effectively used it and being afraid to open **nano**
            during a presentation where I might need to edit some system configuration file and get laughed at.

            It was a pain in the ass, I do not remember how many times I wished going back during the first week. Now I
            am glad I did not and there are no more thoughts about using any IDE in the future.

            It is your choice whether you are willing to invest a bunch of time learning it, what can I say - from my
            point of view, its definetely worth it!

            <h4>Autocompletion</h4>

            <p>Supported through plugins, <a href="http://ctags.sourceforge.net/">ctags</a>. It will not be as feature rich as
            in IDE out of the box. But it can be configured to be. Here is a list of common plugins for autocompletion:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><a href="http://github.com/ervandew/supertab">Supertab</a> - use <strong>Tab</strong> for autocompletion</li>
              <li><a href="http://github.com/shawncplus/phpcomplete.vim">php completion</a> - autocompletion plugin for php.
              Can switch to this plugin based on file extension currently edited.</li>
              <li><a href="https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe">YCM</a> a complete engine for autocompletion</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Generally speaking, autocompletion can be as feature rich as in IDE. Depends on your needs, how far you want it
            to be</p>

              #### File tree navigation

              ViM takes file navigation further than any IDE.

              - [Command-T](https://github.com/wincent/Command-T) - an ultimate tool to find files with minimal number of keystrokes
              - [Nerd-tree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) - a familiar directory/file tree.
              - [Lusty](https://github.com/sjbach/lusty) - another file explorer, useful for fast access to current directory files

              #### Syntastic

              [Syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic) checks and displays syntax errors. IDEs usually
              have more feature rich syntax checkers.

              #### Snipmate

              [Snipmate](https://github.com/garbas/vim-snipmate) is a snippet organizer, very similar to TextMate on Mac.
              [Ultisnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips) is gaining more attraction now.

              #### Zencoding

              [Zencoding](http://github.com/mattn/zencoding-vim) - uses xpath to generate html. As an example transforms
              **ul.help>li*3>a.link** to:

              ```
              <ul class="help">
                <li><a class="link" href=""></a></li>
                <li><a class="link" href=""></a></li>
                <li><a class="link" href=""></a></li>

              #### There are more

              There are a lot more plugins which may increase efficiency. It is up to you, how to configure the environment
              you will work with.

              My point is, that it is possible to have an IDE like functionality in ViM and much more. It will not be out of
              the box. You will have to invest a lot of time, as an estimate:

              - **4** weeks to configure and pick up the coding speed.
              - **2** months to see that you do things faster than in IDE
              - **3-6** months to become a ViM addict
              - next is growth of experience, toolkit, picking up more shortcuts to improve navigation and editing.

              ## It will not be easy

              During the first two weeks, you will most likely switch back to an IDE. It depends on your level
              of interest and stubbornness.

              ![Easy or hard way](img/easy_way.jpg)

              I have tried to make a configuration tutorial, but it just cannot be that common. I will note the
              most important aspects and give you some references.

              ## ViM should be compiled

              If you will not be able to find vim with **ruby**, **python** and **perl** support, you will need
              to compile it on your own. Because useful plugins are depending usually on python or ruby.

              I have tried to make a configuration tutorial, but it just cannot be that common. I will note the
              most important aspects and give you some references.

              ## Terminal client

              A very important part is your terminal client, it should support **256** colors, otherwise using **xterm**
              will look quite ugly. I recommend trying:

              - [rxvt-unicode](http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html) it should be compiled as well with an option
              to enable 256 colors, xft font support. It as well can support virtual transparency.
              - [st](http://st.suckless.org/) should be more simple to install.

              Afterwards, check **zsh** and **oh-my-zsh** and **tmux**. These should help to make your terminal feel nice
              and feature rich.

              You can look at someones **dotfiles** to grab some useful configuration which might suit you as well.
              [Here are mine](https://github.com/l3pp4rd/dotfiles) it also has a screensot. I use **inconsolata** for
              terminal font.

              ## Where to begin configuring ViM

              ```
                touch ~/.vimrc # vim configuration files
                mkdir ~/.vim   # plugins and extensions for vim
              ```

              - Choose a [theme](http://www.vimninjas.com/2012/08/26/10-vim-color-schemes-you-need-to-own/) for syntax coloring
              - Choose a plugin loader [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) or [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle)
              - Investigate vim configuration options and set ones you wish to have, you can look at someones dotfiles for that
              - Choose plugins which fits for you

              **NOTE:** do not copy someone`s configuration without understanding it, everyone has different tastes.

              Follow my blog [gediminasm.org](http://gediminasm.org) RSS feed, I will create a blog post with some configuration
              and plugins to start with soon.
